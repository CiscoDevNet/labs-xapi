# Step 4

We will now update our controller so that it receives events when our device's Ultrasound seetings are modified.
That way, the controller will make sure the widgets stay in sync with the latest settings for our device.

Restart the [control.js](./control.js) code logic from folder `step4`.

Move the slider, and check the value of the text updates simultaneously

Then open your device's admin Web UI and update the Ultrasound value: the widgets should update instantly.
