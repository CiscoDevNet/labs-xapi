# Step 6

We'll now display a custom message if pairing is disabled due to no Ultrasound volume.

Restart the [control.js](./control.js) code logic from folder `step6`.
_Make sure to update the connection settings to your device's ip address and credentials in [controls.js](./control.js)_

Then, move the slider to Zero, and check the custom message shows up in the lower left corner: `/!\ Pairing is disabled`
