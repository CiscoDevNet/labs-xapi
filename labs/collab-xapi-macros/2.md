# Step 1: Macro 'Hello World'

Let's take a quick tour of the **Macro Editor** that is part of the collaboration device web admin UI, and then test running a no-frills sample macro.  The **Macro Editor** combines the ability to manage/upload/export macros, create/edit/run macros as well as providing documentation and tutorials for getting started with macro development:

1. Sign in to your device's web interface (as a user with 'administrator' role) and navigate to the **Integration** > **Macro Editor** menu (it may be helpful to open the editor in a new browser window)

2. The first time the Macro Editor is launched, you are asked to authorize the use of macros

    Click **Yes, enable Macros**

Take some time to explore the various resources provided in the Macro Editor on the right.

Youâ€™ll find several tabs with useful links:

- **Introduction**: this tab contains handy code snippets demonstrating how to invoke commands, listen to events and update configuration settings
- **Examples**: these scripts are organized by use-case, are fully operational, and can be experimented by clicking the **Load Example** button
- **Tutorial**: this guide is an excellent walk-through to help you in your first steps with the macro framework (the guide is also available online here [CE Macros Tutorial](https://github.com/ObjectIsAdvantag/xapi-samples/blob/master/macros/pdf/macro-tutorial.pdf).

**Let's create our first macro:**

1. In the Macro Editor, look for the left panel that helps manage the macros deployed on your device:

    ![Macros Dashboard](assets/images/step2-macro-dashboard.png)

    Click **Create a new macro**

1. Copy and paste in the JavaScript code below:

    ```javascript
    const xapi = require('xapi');

    console.log('Test macro starting up...');
    xapi.config.set('UserInterface CustomMessage', 
        "Hello World! This is your test macro");
    ```

1. Save your macro and rename it `hello`

1. Let's take a peek at the macro code:

    * At the top is `const xapi = require('xapi')` which imports a custom JavaScript package exposing all of the xAPI functionality to the macro code.  This package is identical in function to the [jsxapi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsxapi) package avaialble for Node.js developers.

    This line will be part of just about every macro you build, and enables the script to interact with the local device programmatically
    * The next line `console.log('Test macro starting up...')` will print a short welcome message to the Macro Editor's console window - a handy way to get insight into your script as its running or troubleshoot via 'trace' output
    * The last line `xapi.config.set(...)` uses the `xapi` object created above to send an xAPI command to the local device - here it is configuring the on-screen welcome text to a custom string

    >Note: one big difference between jsxapi scripts running on a remote machine vs macro scripts running on-board: the `jsxapi.connect(...)` step needed in a remote app to connect to the target collaboration device is unnecessary/invalid for a macro, as the `xapi` object is automatically connected to the local device

**Let's fire up your test macro:**

1. Launch your macro by clicking the round toggle shown below:

    ![Running the new macro](assets/images/step2-launch-macro.png)

    You should see some output in the Macro Editor console window, including the message in the `console.log('Test macro starting up...')` command:

    ![Console output](assets/images/step2-console-output.png)

1. You can confirm that the `xapi.config.set(...)` command to set the on-screen custom display message worked by checking your device's main display (if it has one), or switching to the admin web UI and browsing to **Setup** > **Personalization** (scroll down to the bottom):

**Congrats! Your macro is up and running!**
