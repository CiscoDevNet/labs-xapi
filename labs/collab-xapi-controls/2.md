# Step 2: Experience Controls from the Simulator

To get a feeling of the possibilities offered by In-Room Controls, your collaboration device comes with a built-in simulator that can be run straight from a Web browser. 

Open your device's web interface, and sign in with an Integrator or Admin account.

Select the "Integration > In-Room Control" menu entry, and click the "Launch Simulator" button.
_Tip: open a new Web Browser tab when doing so._

The simulator loads a virtual meeting room, equipped with several IoT devices controlled from both switches on the walls, and your Touch10/DX interface as we'll see later in this step. 

The IoT controls let you switch on/off the projector, interact with the projector canvas, close the blinds...

Click on the projector to switch it on/off, and try the switches on the left rear wall to turn the blinds up/down.

Pretty cool isn't it. 
Well, behind the scene, this virtual meeting room does fully interact with your device through xAPI (Cisco's Collaboration Endpoint software's API).

**We’ll now experience your device xAPI's by loading a custom panel on to your device.**

From the left pane, click the "Load simulator config" to deploy the custom panel - and its associated code logic - on to your device.

Answer "OK" to the "Export to codec?" dialog. 
You should see a confirmation message "Success: Example room loaded".

Your device's Touch10/DX interface now shows a "Lights & Blinds" activity. 

_Note for Sandbox users: the next activity cannot be executed as is from Sandbox'ed Room Kits, since you need physical access to a Touch10 interface. We suggest you try the virtual Touch10 interface that is part of the simulation. After loading the "Simulator Configuration" as described below, please refresh the Web page for your Virtual Meeting Room, and click the virtual Touch10. By default the "Climate activity" will load up. Click on the Touch10 background to make all activities appear, and select the "Lights & Blinds activity"._


Click the "Lights & Blinds" activity to open the custom panel that comes with the simulator.

Reach back to the virtual meeting room, and click on the projector to switch it on/off. 
The "projector power" toggle changes in real time.

_Note that if you are running the simulation from an admin account, the simulation will work both ways: as you interact with the Touch10/DX interface, changes will reflect live in the virtual meeting room._

Once you're done with the simulation, press "Clean up" to remove the "Lights & Blinds" and "Climate" activities.
For more information about the Simulator, you can check "Part 2 - Running the simulator" of your device’s Configuration Guide.
