# Creating custom in-room controls and Macros for Cisco collaboration devices

## Objectives

In this lab, we'll explore how to create custom user interface controls for Cisco collaboration devices, and how to connect those controls to custom business logic running on an external Node.js server, or on-board via a room device hosted Javascript 'macro'.

You'll first experience what an 'in-room control' is using the simulator tool available on your device, then learn how to create a custom "ultrasound panel" with your device's Controls Editor.

Once the control UI is built, you'll create a Node.js script to listen for xAPI notifications associated with the new control, with the script updating the device's ultrasound pairing/proximity volume configuration based on user interactions.

Finally, if your device supports JavaScript macros, you will deploy and test the same Node.js script running on your device.

## Prerequisites

* To complete this lab, you will need a Cisco collaboration device (typically a DX, SX, MX,  Roomkit, or Webex Board series) that supports software version CE9.2 or later.

    >Note that the screenshots for this lab have been created with a DX80 running CE9.3

    Alternatively, you can use one of the [RoomKit Sandboxes](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/awesome-xapi#sandboxes) offered to DevNet community members.

* **We recommend that you complete the [Introduction to xAPI](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/lab/collab-xapi-intro/step/1) learning lab, as we will assume you are familiar with your decice's admin interface and xAPI programming.**

* If your device is on-premises registered, make sure you are in possession of the 'administrator' credentials.  If cloud-registered, 'administrator' access to the **Control Hub** of the Cisco Webex organization managing your device is required.

* To complete all steps of this lab, you will need a laptop with local (or VPN) IP connectivity to your device, and the following software tools:

  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v8+ 
  - [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) web browser
  - (Recommended)  A Javascript integrated development environment (IDE) is highly desirable to help you run the "Going Further" exercises, and to make troubleshooting runtime issues easier.  E.g. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

  >Note: check the [Setting up your Javascript IDE](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/tracks/devnet-express-cloud-collab-soft-dev/verify-setup-sd/collab-tools-ide-vscode-sd/step/1) learning lab for detailed guidance on installing Visual Studio Code on your laptop.

## Step 1: Introduction to In-Room Controls

As of _Collaboration Endpoint Software_ version CE9.2+, it is possible to add custom user interface elements to Touch10 interface-operated room meeting systems (SX, MX, RoomKit, Webex Board). Similar functionality is available for adding user interface elements to desktop DX models as well.

Such user interface extensions may be connected to systems and interfaces to drive features like automated room lighting, blinds, climate controls, video screen switches or other peripherals like camera/input switches.  Custom Touch10 controls can drive these systems via direct messages, via interacting with an application server (either external or on-board, via macros), or by communicating with more extensive automation like Creston/AMX systems.

With custom in-room controls, you can create a unified, single-control-panel user experience in the meeting room since both the Cisco video system itself and any peripherals can potentially be controlled from the same Touch10 interface (or DX Series UI.)
