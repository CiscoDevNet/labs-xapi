# Step 8: Creating Macros

In the previous steps, we brought interactivity to an In-Room Controls panel by leveraging the xAPI through an external script.

Since CE9.2.1, Macros offer the possibility to deploy custom Javascript code onto CE devices.
This comes as an alternative to setting up a local server or integrating with an external control system.

> In a nutshell, Macros let you run custom Javascript code logic that interacts with your device through the `xapi` object, as you experienced earlier with the jsxapi wrapper. 
> However, the Macro Framework is limited to local xAPI interaction: you cannot establish remote network connections to servers in order to push or receive data via the Macro Framework code.
> You can learn more about Macros in [Part 4 of CE’s Customization Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/telepresence/endpoint/ce93/sx-mx-dx-room-kit-customization-guide-ce93.pdf).

Sign in to the video system’s web interface **with administrator credentials** and navigate to "Integration > Macro Editor". 

_Note that this step requires an account with admin access, and works for all Cisco Collaboration devices running CE9.2.1+ except SX10 devices._

The first time the Macro Editor is launched on a codec, you are proposed to enable the use of macros.

The left pane of the dashboard lets you manage the macros deployed on your device.

Click "Create a new macro" and paste the contents below as [the new macro](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/labs-xapi/blob/master/code/collab-xapi-controls/togofurther/macro.js):

_Note that the contents are pretty similar to the Node.js script we created ealier. Only the initialization happening at the top of the script differs as, in the cas of Macros, the `xapi` object is automatically instantiated for the device the macro is running on._

```javascript
const xapi = require('xapi')

// Max Ultrasound Volume
const MAX = 90 // for a DX80
//const MAX = 70 // for a RoomKit

xapi.on('ready', () => {
    console.log("connexion successful")

    // Initialize the widgets
    xapi.config.get('Audio Ultrasound MaxVolume')
        .then(updateUI)

    // Update configuration from UI actions
    xapi.event.on('UserInterface Extensions Widget Action', (event) => {
        if (event.WidgetId !== 'volume_slider') return
        if (event.Type !== 'changed') return

        // Update Ultrasound configuration
        const volume = Math.round(parseInt(event.Value) * MAX / 255);
        console.log(`updating Ultrasound configuration to: ${volume}`)
        xapi.config.set('Audio Ultrasound MaxVolume', volume)
    })

    // Update UI from configuration changes
    xapi.config.on('Audio Ultrasound MaxVolume', updateUI)

    // Initialize the widgets also as the controls are deployed
    xapi.event.on('UserInterface Extensions Widget LayoutUpdated', (event) => {
        console.log(`layout updated, let's refresh the widgets`)
        xapi.config.get('Audio Ultrasound MaxVolume')
            .then(updateUI)
    });
})


function updateUI(volume) {
    console.log(`updating UI to new Ultrasound configuration: ${volume}`)

    // Update text
    xapi.command('UserInterface Extensions Widget SetValue', {
        WidgetId: 'volume_text',
        Value: volume
    })
        .then(() => {
            // Update custom message
            let newVolume = parseInt(volume)
            if (newVolume <= 5) {
                xapi.config.set('UserInterface CustomMessage', "/!\\ Pairing is disabled")
                return
            }

            // Pick the message that suits your device's registration mode
            // If spark-registered
            xapi.config.set('UserInterface CustomMessage', "Tip: Launch Webex Teams to pair")
            // If VCS or CUCM registered
            //xapi.config.set('UserInterface CustomMessage', "Tip: pair with me from a Proximity client")
        })

    // Update slider 
    const level = Math.round(parseInt(volume) * 255 / MAX)
    xapi.command('UserInterface Extensions Widget SetValue', {
        WidgetId: 'volume_slider',
        Value: level
    })
}
```

Save your Macro and rename it `controlslab`.

Make sure the Node.js script used in the previous steps is turned of, and enable your Macro by clicking the toggle on its right.

Interact once more with your custom Ultrasound Panel, and observe the logs flying in the console.

**Congrats! Your macro is up and running.**



## To go further

Take some time to discover the resources proposed on the right page of your device's Macro Editor. 
You’ll find several tabs and useful links:
- **Introduction**: this tab contains handful code snippets to invoke commands, listen to events and updating configuration settings
- **Examples**: these scripts are organized by use cases, they are fully operational and can be experimented immediately by clicking the "launch example" button. Watch out: loading an example may override the [Ultrasound panel we used throughout this lab](https://github.com/ObjectIsAdvantag/xapi-samples/blob/master/controls/ultrasound/ultrasound.xml)
- **Tutorial**: this PDF guide is an excellent walkthrough to help you do your first steps with the Macros framework. The file is served from your local device. Click here if you’re looking for an online version of  the [CE 9.2.1+ Macros Tutorial](https://github.com/ObjectIsAdvantag/xapi-samples/blob/master/macros/pdf/macro-tutorial.pdf).

To inspire you, we’ve assembled a set of Controls, Macros and jsxapi scripts samples in this [xAPI samples repo](https://github.com/ObjectIsAdvantag/xapi-samples).
