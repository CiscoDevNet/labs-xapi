# Step 5: Updating your Device's Configuration

The panel created in the previous steps of this lab looks pretty static for now.
Yet, under the cover, events fire every time you interact with the widgets: moving the slider to the left, to the right, pressing, releasing buttons...

Bringing interactivity to an In-Room Control panel happens by adding custom code logic listening to specific events fired by the various widgets.

Update your script with the [extra lines below](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/labs-xapi/blob/master/code/collab-xapi-controls/step3/control.js), placed at the end of the `.on(‘ready’)` block:

```javascript
// CE maximum value for Ultrasound's MaxVolume
const MAX = 90 // for a DX80, and 70 for a RoomKit

xapi.on('ready', () => {
    console.log("connexion successful")

    // Initialize Widgets with current volume
    ...


    // Update configuration from UI actions
    xapi.event.on('UserInterface Extensions Widget Action', (event) => {
        if (event.WidgetId !== 'volume_slider') return
        if (event.Type !== 'changed') return

        // Update Ultrasound configuration
        const volume = Math.round(parseInt(event.Value) * MAX / 255);
        console.log(`updating Ultrasound configuration to: ${volume}`)
        xapi.config.set('Audio Ultrasound MaxVolume', volume)
    })
})
```

On line 12, your code is now registering to listen to `Widget Action` events happening on your device. 

On line 13 and 14, we filter out all events from all widgets, except the state `changed` event for our `volume_slider` widget.

On line 17, we transform once more the slider's value to our device's "Ultrasound MaxVolume" range (0-70 or 0-90 depending on the type of device).

Finally, on line 19, we update our device settings to the slider's current state.

Now, restart your script, and move your panel's slider around.

As you move the slider, you’ll see events flying in the console:

```shell
$  node control.js
connexion successful
current volume is: 60
updating Ultrasound configuration to: 58
updating Ultrasound configuration to: 46
updating Ultrasound configuration to: 39
updating Ultrasound configuration to: 38
updating Ultrasound configuration to: 28
```

Reach to your device's Web UI, and check the value for "Ultrasound MaxVolume" reflects the changes made through the slider.

Excellent! But as you noticed, the "Text" widget does not update... yet. 
We’ll fix that in the next step of the lab.
