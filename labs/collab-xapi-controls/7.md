# Step 7: Extra Events to Consider

In this step, we will add a few tricks to make your custom in-room control panel shine.

To start with, there is one extra event that is worth considering: if you make changes to the layout of your panel in the **In Room Editor** and re-upload to the device, an event is fired which can be caught by your script (`xapi.event.on('UserInterface Extensions Widget LayoutUpdated',...)`).  This can allow the script to re-initialize any settings (like the volume widget values) without needing to be restarted or wait for a config/UI event to occur.

1. Add the code below to the end of your current script:

  ```javascript
  xapi.event.on('UserInterface Extensions Widget LayoutUpdated', (event) => {
      console.log(`layout updated, let's refresh the widgets`)
      xapi.config.get('Audio Ultrasound MaxVolume')
          .then((volume) => updateUI(volume));
  });
  ```

2. Re-start the script, then from the **In-Room Editor** re-export your custom control panel to the device (no need to make any actual changes).

  Check that your script console shows that the Layout event is received, and that your Touch10 UI reflects the proper volume setting

**One last customization...**

As the ultrasound volume gets close to zero, it would be helpful to display a message on the Touch10 UI to warn users that pairing is not possible for the device.

Conversely, when pairing is available, we could invite users to pair from their Webex Teams app or Proximity client via that same on-screen message mechanism.

Let's implement it:

1. Replace the complete `function updateUI()` section of the `control.js` script with the code below:

```javascript
function updateUI(volume) {
    console.log(`updating UI to new Ultrasound configuration: ${volume}`)

    // Update text
    xapi.command('UserInterface Extensions Widget SetValue', {
        WidgetId: 'volume_text',
        Value: volume
    })

    // Update slider
    const level = Math.round(parseInt(volume) * 255 / MAX)
    xapi.command('UserInterface Extensions Widget SetValue', {
        WidgetId: 'volume_slider',
        Value: level
    })

    // Update custom message
    let newVolume = parseInt(volume);
    if (newVolume <= 5) {
        xapi.config.set('UserInterface CustomMessage', "/!\\ Pairing is disabled");
    }
    else {
        xapi.config.set('UserInterface CustomMessage', "Tip: Audio pairing is enabled");
    }
}
```
>Note: be careful when you cut/copy/paste, so as to keep beginning/ending braces { } correct

2. Restart your script, then change the ultrasound volume to zero using the control panel's slider widget.

  Check the lower-left corner of your device's main screen display the confrim the updated custom message:

  >Note: if your device doesn't have a main screen display or you can't see it, check the web configuration UI under **Setup -> Personalization** to see a small rendering of what your displays would look like, including any custom messages
