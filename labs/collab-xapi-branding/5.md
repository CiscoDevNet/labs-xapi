# Step 4: Branding via Node.js / JavaScript

In the final step of this lab, you will leverage ‘jsxapi’ – the Node.js JavaScript wrapper for xAPI – in order to customize your device from an external Node.js application.

>If you’re new to the [Node.js jsxapi library](https://github.com/cisco-ce/jsxapi), you can learn to run a Node.js script to interact with your device by following [Step 7 of the "Introduction to xAPI" lab](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/lab/collab-xapi-intro/step/7)

1. From a PC terminal, clone the [jsxapi samples project](https://github.com/ObjectIsAdvantag/xapi-samples) from GitHub, and install needed dependencies (including the jsxapi library, and its sub-dependencies):

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/ObjectIsAdvantag/xapi-samples
    cd xapi-samples
    cd jsxapi
    npm install
    ```

2. Then, create and edit a new file named `customMessage.js` in the 'jsxapi' directory.  Paste  in the code below:

    ```javascript
    const jsxapi = require('jsxapi');

    // Connect to the device
    console.log("connecting to your device...");
    const xapi = jsxapi.connect("ssh://{device_ip}", {
        username: "integrator",
        password: "integrator"
    });
    xapi.on('error', (err) => {
        console.error(`connexion failed: ${err}, exiting`);
        process.exit(1);
    });
    xapi.on('ready', () => {
        console.log("connexion successful");

        // Update Awake message
        xapi.config.set('UserInterface CustomMessage', "I am a code addict")
            .then(() => {
                console.info('updated Awake message');
                xapi.close();
            })
            .catch((err) => {
                console.error(`could not update Awake message : ${err.message}`);
                xapi.close();
            });
    });
    ```

  Make sure to replace with your device’s IP Address and user credentials in the code where appropriate.

3. Finally, run the script by typing in the terminal:

    ```shell
    node customMessage.js
    ```

    Check that the custom message displays on the screen attached to your device, when in 'awake' state

Congrats, you've successfully updated your device from a Node.js script!

If you are interested in adding a custom branding logo, please check out the [sample code here](https://github.com/ObjectIsAdvantag/xapi-samples/blob/master/jsxapi/6-branding-logo.js).

## Going further

In this lab, we showed how to add your own branding messages and images via code, illustrating how it is possible to update one or several devices programatically.

Another possible use of branding via code might be to create custom rolling images or messages, perhaps a "message of the day" or "picture of the day" feature for your meeting rooms.

You may want to check out this [Node.js sample script](https://github.com/ObjectIsAdvantag/xapi-samples/blob/master/jsxapi/5-rolling-messages.js) which rolls a custom text message to the device screen every 3 seconds.
