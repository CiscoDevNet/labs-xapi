# Personalizing Collaboration Devices from Code

## Objectives

Since version 9.2 of Cisco Collaboration Endpoint software (CE9.2+), Branding and Halfwake customization let you personalize the appearance of the screen and the Touch10 interface.

In this lab, you’ll learn to add your own logo signage and custom messages to a Cisco Collaboration device from the Administration Web User Interface and code (ssh, HTTP requests and jsxapi).

## Pre-requisites

To complete this lab, you need to have a Cisco Collaboration device at hand that:
- supports Cisco TelePresence CE software, typically a DX, SX, MX or RoomKit._ Note that moving from Android to CE software can be achevied from upgrade.cisco.com_
- is registered to either Cisco Spark, an on-premises CUCM or Expressway

Moreover, make sure you are in possession of the 'admin' credentials for your device if it is on-premises registered.
If Spark-registered, 'admin' access to the Control Hub of the Cisco Spark organization of your device is required.

To complete al steps of this lab, you'll also need a laptop with local IP connectivity to your device, Node.js (in order to run the 'jsxapi' instructions), plus a SSH client and an HTTP client (either curl or Postman).

**Finally, we recommend you have taken the [Introduction to xAPI](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/lab/collab-xapi-intro/step/1) learning lab, as this lab assumes you are familiar with CE customization and xAPI programming.**


## About Personalization and Corporate Branding

Branding and halfwake customization let you upload your own text and images to customize the appearance of the screen and the Touch10 interface. 

In the 'Halfwake' state, you can: 
- add a background brand image to the screen and the Touch10 interface
- add a small logo in the bottom right corner of the screen and the Touch10 interface
- customize or remove the message at the center of the screen (only the screen, not the Touch10)

In the 'Awake' state, you can: 
- add a small logo to the bottom right corner of the screen and the Touch10 interface
- add a label or message to the bottom left corner of the screen (not the Touch10 interface)

The features above are accessible from both administrator and integrator roles, giving you the possibility to customize not only on-premises but also Spark-registered devices.

One last remark: be aware that you cannot use the Branding feature and a Custom Wallpaper at the same time.

Check these guides for further details on Branding and Halfwake customization for Room Kits. Note that DX, SX, MX series propose the same capabilities as documented in these guides.
