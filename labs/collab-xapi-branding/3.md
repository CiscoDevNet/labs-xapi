# Step 2: Branding via SSH

In this step, we'll perform the same personalization from commands sent from your device's t-shell, on the command line.

Open a terminal, and create an ssh session to your device. 
For detailed instructions, please refer to [step 5 of "Introduction to xAPI"](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/lab/collab-xapi-intro/step/5) learning lab.

Connect as 'admin' or 'integrator', and type the command below to update the custom message displayed when the device is active.

```shell
xconfiguration UserInterface CustomMessage: "Hi from ssh"
```

Updating the logo in Halfwake state takes a bit more of a work. 
Indeed, any PNG image must to be Base64 encoded, before it can be transferred to your device. 

We’ll use an online service for the purpose of Base64 encoding a provided image.

Open https://www.base64-image.de/ in a Web browser, and drag your PNG logo (or the [PNG logo](TODO) provided in the previous step of this lab) on to the Web page.

After a few seconds, the conversion completes and a new entry is generated as shown above.

Click `show code`, and copy the full encoded string starting after `data:image/png;base64,`

Finally reach back to your device’s ssh session, and type the command below to change the logo displayed in 'Halfwake' mode.

Press 'Enter' after the cammand `xcommand UserInterface Branding Upload Type: HalfwakeBranding`, then paste the encoded string for your logo, and add a `.` character after pressing 'enter' to inform of the completeness for the image bytes to upload, as illustrated below:

```shell
xcommand UserInterface Branding Upload Type: HalfwakeBranding
6L/WX4h5Jn5bhsbhaZQkPSu21/8HecUSKxApm9LH3pyLN333kB5G+LgV7IvPbX1xMHkQT3i98PSbi4G1wcZ....................................................................................................................................saWvtjr38/DZO1POtY2fuB7SSz03rdh2LXkijRI5GHQ1g3cdjjW/gtDQ1tj9RW936V+yD+WtzY/u9+OD4vn6DY/ep7II1y+KN13b/9tOn/lYmpsHbUWaUKR2DOJYCOdJPZU8EFsCRwly/dvdxeLL
.

OK
\*r BrandingUploadResult (status=OK):
\*\* end
```

As the upload completes successfully, you get an 'OK' response from your device as shown above.

Finally, type `xcommand Standby Halfwake` to make your device switch to 'Halfwake' mode, and check your logo shows up:
