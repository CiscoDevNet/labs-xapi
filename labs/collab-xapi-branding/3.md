# Step 2: Branding via SSH

In this step, we'll perform the same personalizations as before, by sending commands from your device's 'T-Shell' command line interface, accessible via SSH.

**Updating the onscreen 'awake' text message is easy...**

1. On your PC, open a terminal window and create an SSH session to your device.
For detailed instructions, please refer to [Step 5 of "Introduction to xAPI"](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/lab/collab-xapi-intro/step/5):

    ```Shell
    ssh {room_device_ip} -l {user name}
    ```

    If you've completed the xAPI intro lab, you can use the `integrator` user with `integrator` as password

2.  Once the T-Shell command line interface is ready, enter the command below to update the custom message displayed when the device is active:

    ```shell
    xconfiguration UserInterface CustomMessage: "Hi from ssh"
    ```

    Note that the quotes around the message string are required

3. Make sure your device is in awake state, and confirm that your message is displayed

**Updating the logo for halfwake state takes a bit more work...**

xAPI requires that you provide the _complete, actual image data_ when you send the command to update an image - it doesn't accept a URL or a file location.  As you might expect, it is not really possible to type (or even copy/paste) the entire raw binary image data stream into a SSH session.  However, it is _just_ possible to convert that binary data stream into a (really long) encoded text stream (using Base64 encoding) and paste that it into the session.  

In fact, that's just what we'll do now...  Weâ€™ll first use an online tool (thanks to Browserling.com) where we can upload a test image to be Base64 encoded:

1. Open https://www.browserling.com/tools/image-to-base64 in your web browser, and choose/drag+drop a PNG file into the indicated box, and click **Convert**.  You can use [this sample logo  ](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/posts/files/collab-xapi-branding/assets/images/logo-create-translucide.png) if you like:

    ![Convert Image](assets/images/convert-image-service.png)

    After a few seconds, the conversion completes and a box full of converted image data is displayed, as above

2. Copy the _entire_ encoded string to your PC's clipboard (**Ctrl+A** / **Ctrl+C** may help)

3. Finally, back in your SSH session, complete the following sequence.  First, type:

    ```shell
    xcommand UserInterface Branding Upload Type: HalfwakeBranding
    ```
  
    **(press Enter)**

    **(paste in the complate encoded image text string from above)**

    **(press Enter)**

    ```Shell
    .
    ```

    (i.e., type a single period by itself)
    
    **(press Enter)**

    This should look a little like the below (notwithstanding a large amount of image data ommitted:)

    ```shell
    xcommand UserInterface Branding Upload Type: HalfwakeBranding
    6L/WX4h5Jn5bhsbhaZQkPSu21/8HecUSKxApm9LH3pyLN333kB5G+LgV7IvPbX1xMHkQT3i98PSbi4G1wcZ[redacted]]saWvtjr38/DZO1POtY2fuB7SSz03rdh2LXkijRI5GHQ1g3cdjjW/gtDQ1tj9RW936V+yD+WtzY/u9+OD4vn6DY/ep7II1y+KN13b/9tOn/lYmpsHbUWaUKR2DOJYCOdJPZU8EFsCRwly/dvdxeLL
    .
    ```

    If the upload completed successfully, you will get an 'OK' response:

    ```shell
    OK
    \*r BrandingUploadResult (status=OK):
    \*\* end
    ```


4. Finally, enter:

    ```shell
    xcommand Standby Halfwake
    ```

    to make your device switch to halfwake mode, where you can confirm that your custom logo is displayed
