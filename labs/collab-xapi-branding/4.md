# Step 3: Branding via HTTP/REST

In this step, we will experiment with changing branding options using a REST HTTP client.

>Note: we will be using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) in this lab. If you are new to using Postman with xAPI, take a look at [Step 6 of the "Introduction to xAPI"](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/lab/collab-xapi-intro/step/6) lab to learn how to forge an HTTP request with 'Basic Auth' credentials

**Let’s start by setting a custom message for the device's 'awake' state:**

1. Open Postman, and create a `POST` request to the `/putxml` resource of your device with the following XML payload:

	```xml
	<Configuration>
		<UserInterface>
			<CustomMessage>Hey from Postman</CustomMessage>
		</UserInterface>
	</Configuration>
	```

	Do not forget to set your 'Basic Auth' credentials as shown below (you can use `Basic aW50ZWdyYXRvcjppbnRlZ3JhdG9y` if using the 'integrator' user from a previous lab:)

	![Set Credentials](assets/images/postman-credentials.png)	

	![Post Custom Message](assets/images/postman-post-custom-message.png)

2. Check that the response shows **200 OK**

3. Now, view your device's screen, and confirm that the message at the bottom-left corner has updated

>Tip: if you click the `code` link (under the Save button) in Postman, and choose **cURL** from among the listed programming languages, you'll generate a shell command such as, which will reproduce your request exactly using the cURL command:

```shell
curl -X POST \
	http://192.168.1.34/putxml \
	-H 'Authorization: Basic aW50ZWdyYXRvcjppbnRlZ3JhdG9yDQo=' \
	-H 'Content-Type: text/xml' \
	-d '<Configuration>
		<UserInterface>
			<CustomMessage>Hey from Postman</CustomMessage>
		</UserInterface>
	</Configuration>'
```

Congrats, you successfully updated your device with a remote HTTP request!

**Let’s now change the branding logo image for the 'halfwake' state**

1. Duplicate the previous request in Postman, and replace the payload with the 'Branding > Upload' XML proposed below:

		Make sure to paste-in the complete Base64 encoded string of your image in the `<body>` element:

		```xml
		<Command>
			<UserInterface>
				<Branding>
					<Upload>
						<Type>HalfwakeBranding</Type>
						<body>{your image data}</body>
					</Upload>
				</Branding>
			</UserInterface>
		</Command>
		```

2. Click **Send**, and make sure your device is in halfwake state (use the device's web UI to change the state as needed)

3. Check that the uploaded image shows up in the bottom-right corner of the screen

>Tip: for further Postman exploration, you are invited to import one of the [Postman collections for xAPI](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/postman-xapi) for on-premise and cloud-registered devices. In the collections, you will discover several extra requests that implement additional commands for branding your device
