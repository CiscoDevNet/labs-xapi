# Step 3: Branding with HTTP requests

In this step, we will experiment branding from a REST HTTP Client. 

_We will use Postman for the sake of this lab. If you are new to using Postman over xAPI, take a look at [step 6 of the "Introduction to xAPI"](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/lab/collab-xapi-intro/step/6) to learn to forge an HTTP request with 'Basic Auth' credentials._

**Let’s start by placing a custom message when your device is in the 'Awake' state.**

Open Postman, and create a POST request to the /putxml resource of your device with the following XML payload:

```xml
<Configuration>
	<UserInterface>
		<CustomMessage>Hey from Postman</CustomMessage>
	</UserInterface>
</Configuration>
```

Do not forget to set your 'Basic Auth' credentials as shown below:

<div align="left">![Set Credentials](/post/files/collab-xapi-branding/assets/images/postman-credentials.png)</div><br/><br/>

<div align="left">![Post Custom Message](/post/files/collab-xapi-branding/assets/images/postman-post-custom-message.png)</div><br/><br/>


Check you device responds with '200 OK'.

Now, reach to your device's screen, and check the message at the bottom left corner has changed.

> Tip: if you click the `code link` under the Save button in Postman, and choose cURL among the proposed programming languages, you'll generate a shell command such as:

```shell
curl -X POST \
  http://192.168.1.34/putxml \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic aW50ZWdyYXRvcjppbnRlZ3JhdG9yDQo=' \
  -H 'Content-Type: text/xml' \
  -d '<Configuration>
	<UserInterface>
		<CustomMessage>Hey from Postman</CustomMessage>
	</UserInterface>
</Configuration>'
```

Congrats, you successfully updated your device from a remote HTTP request, and eventually from code.


**Let’s now change the branding image in 'Halfwake' state**

Duplicate the previous request in Postman, and replace the payload with the 'Branding > Upload' command proposed below. 

_Make sure to paste the Base64 encoded string of your image as described in step 2._

```xml
<Command>
 <UserInterface>
 	<Branding>
 		<Upload>
 			<Type> HalfwakeBranding </Type>
	<body>iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAQAAAARnQU1BAACxjwv8YQUAAAAJcEhZcwAAEnQAABJ0Ad5mH3gAAA8MSURBVHhe7d2/WuJMH8bx4T0WsNjLI4hHgDZb2W4HJTZ2T2m3DZbSbWtlIxyBHIGXxcK58E40rqjJzOTOBPLn+7mu2YdnVwkEcjO/yWQY7CwDAIL……………………………….lLlS5hI1LUAAAAASUVORK5CYII=</body>
 		</Upload>
 	</Branding>
 </UserInterface>
</Command>
```

Click `Send`, and turn your device to Halfwake state. 
Check the uploaded image shows up in the bottom right corner of the screen.

> Tip: you are invited to import one of the [postman collections for xAPI](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/postman-xapi) for on-premises and Spark-registered devices (aka, limited to integrator role supported commands). Once you have proceeded, you will discover several extra templated requests that implement the commands to brand your device.
