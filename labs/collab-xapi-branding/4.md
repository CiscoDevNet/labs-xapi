# Step 3: Branding with HTTP requests

In this step, we will experiment branding from a REST HTTP Client. We will use both Postman for the sake of this lab. If you are new to using Postman over the xAPI, you can learn to forge HTTP request with your xAPI Basic Auth credentials in [step 6 of the "Introduction to xAPI"](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/lab/collab-xapi-intro/step/6) learning lab.

Let’s start by placing a custom message when your device is in the Awake state.
Open Postman, and create a POST request to the /putxml resource of your device with the following XML payload:

```xml
<Configuration>
	<UserInterface>
		<CustomMessage>Hey from Postman</CustomMessage>
	</UserInterface>
</Configuration>
```

Do not forget your BasicAuth credentials, as shown below:

![Set Credentials](./assets/images/postman-credentials.png)
<div align="left">![Set Credentials](/post/files/collab-xapi-branding/assets/images/postman-credentials.png)</div><br/><br/>

![Post Custom Message](./assets/images/postman-post-custom-message.png)
<div align="left">![Post Custom Message](/post/files/collab-xapi-branding/assets/images/postman-post-custom-message.png)</div><br/><br/>


Ensure the response is 200 OK, and reach to your device to check the message at the bottom left corner has just changed.

Tip: click code, and choose cURL to generate a shell command such as:

```shell
curl -X POST \
  http://192.168.1.34/putxml \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic aW50ZWdyYXRvcjppbnRlZ3JhdG9yDQo=' \
  -H 'Content-Type: text/xml' \
  -d '<Configuration>
	<UserInterface>
		<CustomMessage>Hey from Postman</CustomMessage>
	</UserInterface>
</Configuration>'
```

**Let’s now change the branding image in Halfwake mode**

Replace the payload of the previous request with the Branding / Upload command below. Make sure to paste the Base64 encoded string of your image as described in step 2.

```xml
<Command>
 <UserInterface>
 	<Branding>
 		<Upload>
 			<Type> HalfwakeBranding </Type>
	<body>iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAQAAAARnQU1BAACxjwv8YQUAAAAJcEhZcwAAEnQAABJ0Ad5mH3gAAA8MSURBVHhe7d2/WuJMH8bx4T0WsNjLI4hHgDZb2W4HJTZ2T2m3DZbSbWtlIxyBHIGXxcK58E40rqjJzOTOBPLn+7mu2YdnVwkEcjO/yWQY7CwDAIL……………………………….lLlS5hI1LUAAAAASUVORK5CYII=</body>
 		</Upload>
 	</Branding>
 </UserInterface>
</Command>
```

Tip: import the ready-to-use [postman collections for xAPI](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/postman-xapi) available for both on-premises and spark-registered devices (aka, limited to integrator role supported commands), and get more template requests to brand your device.
