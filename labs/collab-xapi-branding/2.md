# Step 1: Branding via the Web UI

Sign in to the web interface of your device, and navigate to `Setup > Personalization`.

The `Branding` tab should open by default. 
From this page you can add your own branding elements (background image, logo, custom message) to the video system. 

Scroll the page down to the 'Wake up flow' section to customize the 'Halfwake User Experience' settings for your device.

Press the `Standby` and `Halfwake` buttons alternatively to change the state of your device with no delay: no need to wait minutes for your device to switch to Standby, nor someone to enter the room for your system to switch to Halfwake state.

Look for the 'Brand Logo' section, and click `upload image`.

<div align="left">![Brand Logo](/post/files/collab-xapi-branding/assets/images/brand-logo.png)</div><br/><br/>


Select the [provided logo](), or a custom PNG image, ideally with transparent background and 272x272 pixels size.

Press the `Put the system in Halfwake state` button and check your logo is displayed on the screen and also on your Touch10 if it applies.
     

**We will now go through the steps to customize your device when in 'Awake' state.**

Scroll down the Branding page, and enter a custom text such as "Hello from the Web Interface". Click `Save`.

<div align="left">![Change Custom Text](/post/files/collab-xapi-branding/assets/images/custom-text.png)</div><br/><br/>


Press the `Put the system in Awake state` button and check your message is displayed in the bottom left corner of your screen. 
_Note that the custom message does not display on the Touch10._

**Congrats, youâ€™ve successfully customized your device.**

In the next steps of this lab, we will perform the same modifications from code, by invoking your device's embedded xAPI.
