# Step 8: Starting video calls programmatically

Using xAPI to automatically start a video call really shows the dynamic power available to applications and developers! The good news is it's just as easy to do from xAPI (via SSH, HTTP or JavaScript) as the commands you've already explored...

>Note: in order to successfully place an actual video call, your collaboration device must be fully registered to a call control service, with all video calling configurations in place.  If you can place a call manually using the device's standard controls, you should be in good shape for this step.  Un-registered devices can still _place_ calls, but the calls will be unsuccessful...

**Let’s dial a video call via SSH**

1. To start with, consult the documentation in the API reference guide of your specific device to get an idea of the xAPI xcommand and required parameters for 'dial'-ing a destination.

    If you are testing with a RoomKit device running CE9.5, navigate to page 216 of the [API Reference Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/telepresence/endpoint/ce95/collaboration-endpoint-software-api-reference-guide-ce95.pdf).

    >Note that URLs to reference guides for DX, SX and MX devices are provided in Step 1 of this lab

1. For the sake of this example, we’ll use the SIP auto-answering video test URI `roomkit@sparkdemos.com` (provided by the Cisco Telepresence team in Oslo) as the destination for our video call (not all systems will be able to reach this destination - consult your Cisco collab admin to get a valid destination URI or directory number.)

    Open a SSH session to your device, and enter:

    ```shell
    xcommand Dial Number: roomkit@sparkdemos.com
    ```

    The call should be initiated, with a 'call identifier' `CallId` geting returned immediately:

    ```shell
    OK
    *r DialResult (status=OK):
    *r DialResult CallId: 7
    *r DialResult ConferenceId: 4
    ** end
    ```

This identifier can be used in subsequent requests, for example to disconnect the call or check on the status of the call:

**Now let's make the same call with jsxapi**

1. Back in the directory where you created the `index.js` file previously, create a new file named `call.js`, and paste in the code below:

    ```javascript
    const jsxapi = require('jsxapi');

    //create the jsxapi connection object
    const xapi = jsxapi.connect("ssh://{device_ip}", {
    username: 'integrator',
    password: 'integrator'
    });

    xapi.on('error', (err) => {  //handler for any errors encountered with jsxapi
    console.error(`connection failed: ${err}, exiting`);
    process.exit(1); //just exit the app
    });

    //when the jsxapi connection is ready...
    xapi.on('ready', () => {
    console.log("connection successful");

    // Start a call
    xapi.command('Dial', { Number: 'roomkit@sparkdemos.com' })
        .then((call) => {
            console.log(`Started call with status: ${call.status}, id: ${call.CallId}`);

            // Stop call after delay
            const delay = 20;
            setTimeout(() => {
                console.log('Disconnecting call, and exiting.');

                xapi.command('Call Disconnect', { CallId: call.CallId })
                    .then(process.exit);
            }, delay * 1000);
            console.log(`Call will be disconnected in ${delay} seconds...`);

        })
        .catch((err) => {
            // Frequent error here is to have several on-going calls
            // reason: "Maximum limit of active calls reached"
            console.error(`Error making call: ${err.message}`)
        });
    });
    ```

1. Again, update with your device's IP Address and your user's credentials as needed.

    Be sure to save the file!

1. All set! Now, run your script with the command:

    ```shell
    node call.js
    ```

**Next, let's use cURL to make a new call via HTTP**

Open a terminal, and enter the `curl` command below (be sure to replace with your device's IP address, and credentials/destination if different):

**Mac/Linux:**

```shell
curl --insecure -X POST https://{device_ip}/putxml \
-H 'Authorization: Basic aW50ZWdyYXRvcjppbnRlZ3JhdG9y' \
-H 'Content-Type: text/xml' \
-d '<Command><Dial><Number>roomkit@sparkdemos.com</Number></Dial></Command>'
```

**Windows**

```shell
curl --insecure -X POST https://{device_ip}/putxml ^
-H "Authorization: Basic aW50ZWdyYXRvcjppbnRlZ3JhdG9y" ^
-H "Content-Type: text/xml" ^
-d "<Command><Dial><Number>roomkit@sparkdemos.com</Number></Dial></Command>"
```

**Finally, let's dial it using Postman**

1. Create a new `POST` request to `https://device_ip}/putxml` with the same **Authorization** header as in Step 6 (`Basic aW50ZWdyYXRvcjppbnRlZ3JhdG9y`)

1. Fill in the XML payload as shown below in the **Body** area (use the 'raw' view):

    ```xml
    <Command>
        <Dial>
            <Number>roomkit@sparkdemos.com</Number>
        </Dial>
    </Command>
    ```

1. Add a **Header** with **Key** = `Content-Type` and **Value** = `text/xml`, then click **Send**

**Congrats!**

In this lab, you learned how the xAPI lets you take action directly from a SSH terminal, from the PC command line, using a REST test tool via HTTP, and programmatically using the jsxapi JavaScript library.

Hopefully you can take the overview and details from the language/tool specific examples shown in this lab, and apply the concepts to your favorite Dev-Ops and developer tool-chains.  You can now control and interact with your Cisco collaboration device directly from your own applications!

## Going further

**Postman** users will also be interested in downloading/importing the [Postman collections for xAPI](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/postman-xapi). These collections provide examples of common device interactions seen in this lab such as 'Standby' and 'Video Calls', as well as additional features like 'Personalization' and 'Room Analytics'.

We suggest you try your hand at some additional labs to learn more about the programmability features of your device, including [Personalizing Collaboration Devices from Code](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/lab/collab-xapi-branding/step/1) and [Creating custom In-Room Controls and Macros](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/lab/collab-xapi-controls/step/1).

Plus try out some additional [introductory samples](https://github.com/ObjectIsAdvantag/xapi-samples), and check the [awesome-xapi](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/awesome-xapi) github repo for extra community contributed code samples, or contribute your own!
