# Step 8: Starting a Video Call programmatically

To start with, consult the documentation in the API reference Guide of your device.
If you own a RoomKit device, navigate to page 119 of the [API Reference Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/telepresence/endpoint/ce92/room-kit-api-reference-guide-ce92.pdf).

_Note that URLs to reference guides for DX, SX and MX devices are provided in step 1 of this lab_

### Let’s dial a Video call from ssh

For the sake of this example, we’ll use the SIP autoresponder `roomkit@sparkdemos.com` proposed by the CE team in Oslo.

Open a SSH session, and type `xcommand Dial Number: roomkit@sparkdemos.com`

The call is initiated, and a call identifier is returned immediately. This identifier can be used to disconnect the call and check on the status of the call.

```shell
xcommand Dial Number: roomkit@sparkdemos.com

OK
*r DialResult (status=OK):
*r DialResult CallId: 7
*r DialResult ConferenceId: 4
** end
```


### We will now initiate the call with the jsxapi

Come back to the folder where you created the 'standby.js' file, copy the contents into a new file named 'call.js', and replace lines 14 to 22 (instruction `xapi.status.get('Standby')`) with the contents below:

```javascript
    // Start a call
    xapi.command('Dial', { Number: 'roomkit@sparkdemos.com' })
        .then((call) => {
            console.log(`Started call with status: ${call.status}, id: ${call.CallId}`);

            // Stop call after delay
            const delay = 20;
            setTimeout(() => {
                console.log('Disconnecting call, and exiting.');

                xapi.command('Call Disconnect', { CallId: call.CallId })
                    .then(process.exit);
            }, delay * 1000);
            console.log(`Call with be disconnected in ${delay} seconds...`);

        })
        .catch((err) => {
            // Frequent error here is to have several on-going calls
            // reason: "Maximum limit of active calls reached"
            console.error(`Error in call: ${err.message}`)
        });
```

All set! Now, run your script with the command `node call.js`.


### Finally, we will use CURL and Postman to request a new call from HTTP

Open a terminal, and type the `curl` command below **from a Mac/Linux shell**:

```shell
curl -X POST http://192.168.1.34/putxml \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic aW50ZWdyYXRvcjppbnRlZ3JhdG9y' \
  -H 'Content-Type: text/xml' \
  -d '<Command><Dial><Number>roomkit@sparkdemos.com</Number></Dial></Command>'
```


Let's now do it from Postman.
Create a new POST request with the same 'Authorization' header as in step 6, and fill in the XML payload as show below:

Congrats!
In this lab, you learned how the xAPI let you take action straight from a SSH terminal, but also through HTTP.
By replicating the HTTP requests of this lab from your favorite programming language, you can now control and interact with your Cisco Collaboration device straight from your own applications.


## To go further

Postman users will also be interested to load the [postman collections for xAPI](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/postman-xapi), as these collections propose popular device interactions such as: 'Standby', 'Video Calls', but also 'Personalization' and 'Room Analytics'.

We suggest you take a few other labs from the xAPI module (coming) in order to learn more about programmability capabilities of your device, such as In-room Controls and Macros. 
And don't miss the official [Macros samples on DevNet](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/roomdevices-macros-samples) and these [introductory samples](https://github.com/ObjectIsAdvantag/xapi-samples).
