# Step 4: Tour of Your Room Device’s Web Interface

In the previous steps, we created an integrator user. We’ll now connect with this account and take a tour of the web interface:

1. From a brower, open the IP-address of your room device, and sign out if you're already signed in, by clicking on the username in the top right corner

2. Sign in with the newly created 'integrator' user credentials
    You are then redirected to the room device’s onboard web interface, as show below:

    <div align="left">![Web Interface as Integrator](assets/images/step4-web-interface.png)</div><br/>

    The available menu entries are:
    - **Home:** your device’s informations
    - **Setup**
       - Configuration: read or change configuration parameters
       - Status: current state of your device
       - Personalization: modify text and branding images
    - **Maintenance**
       - Restart
    - **Integration**
       - In-Room Control: let’s you add extra custom User Interface components

3. Click `Setup > Status > Standby` to check your device’s current standby state:
  <div align="left">![Standby Status](assets/images/step4-standby-status.png)</div><br/>

4. Now click `Setup > Configuration > Standby`

5. Make sure the **Control** setting is set to `On`, so that your system goes into standby when the indicated delay has elapsed

6. Changed the **Delay** setting to `5`, so that after 5 minutes of inactivity, your system will automatically go to 'Standby' mode

7. Click **Save**

> Note: You can also change the **WakeUpOnMotion** setting to have your system wake up when someone enters the room!

We’ll now use SSH to change the device’s standby state from your PC's command line...
