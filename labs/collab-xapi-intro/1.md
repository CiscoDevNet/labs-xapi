# Introduction to xAPI for Cisco collaboration devices

## Objectives

Throughout this lab, we’ll explore the programmability of Cisco collaboration devices.

You’ll learn about xAPI – the API exposed by the [Cisco Collaboration Endpoint software - CE9](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/telepresence/endpoint/software/ce9/release-notes/ce-software-release-notes-ce9.pdf), and how to invoke the API from SSH, HTTP and Node.js/Javascript.

To make it concrete, we’ll illustrate xAPI and CE customization by showing how to configure your device and start video calls, for both cloud and on-premises registered devices.

## Prerequisites

* A Cisco collaboration device with the following requirements:
  - Cisco DX, SX, MX, RoomKit, or Webex Board
  - Running the _Cisco Collaboration Endpoint CE v9.2+_ version of software (CE 9.6+ for Webex Board)
  - Registered to the Cisco Webex cloud platform, or to an on-premise Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM) or Cisco Video Control Server (VCS) 

  Alternatively, you can use one of the [RoomKit Sandboxes](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/awesome-xapi#sandboxes) offered to DevNet community members.

* Admin credentials to your device, if it's on-premise registered. If cloud-registered, you need admin access to the [Control Hub](https://admin.webex.com/login) of the organization to which your device blongs.

* Laptop with local or VPN IP connectivity to your device, and the following software tools, recommended:
  - SSH: Mac/Linux (built-in); Windows - [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/)
  - cURL: Mac/Linux (built-in); Windows - [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/)
  - REST API test client: cross-platform - [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v8+ 

## Step 1: About CE customization and xAPI

If you’re new to CE device customization and xAPI, here are a few starting points:

- Your Cisco collaboration device includes an API - known as **xAPI** - that allows bi-directional communication with third-party applications and control systems, such as those from AMX or Crestron
- There are multiple ways to access xAPI: Telnet/SSH, HTTP, and RS-232 serial connection. Regardless of the method you choose, xAPI has the same general format and behaves similarly
- In this lab, we’ll focus on the SSH and HTTP interfaces

**CE customization via xAPI** has been historically available for the SX, MX, DX and Room Series video systems running CE – Cisco Collaboration Endpoint Software.
The exact set of customization and API features and supported devices vary depending on the model and version of CE. Please check the [Cisco TelePresence CE software Release Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/telepresence/endpoint/software/ce9/release-notes/ce-software-release-notes-ce9.pdf) for the complete list of supported devices.

>Note: Cisco DX Series were originally shipped with Android-based software, which does not support xAPI. Starting From Cisco Collaboration Endpoint software version 8.2 (CE8.2) all DX70 and DX80 units can run CE software, which is the software family that runs on the Cisco TelePresence SX, MX and Room Kit Series.

### In-room controls and macros

In January 2017, CE9.2 introduced customizable **in-room controls**. In-room controls let you add custom user interface elements to the **Touch10** display used to control room devices (as well as the on-screen control interface of the DX Series.) Such user interface extensions can trigger applications to control aspects of the device itself or affect in-room lighting, blinds, video switches, or other peripherals. These user interface extensions can be bi-directionally integrated with additional external control systems (e.g. AMX/Crestron) via xAPI.

In November 2017, CE9.2.1 took the customization possibilities further, with the introduction of **branding** and **halfwake** display features, while also introducing a powerful **macro** engine. Macros provide a JavaScript run-time environment on board the collaboration device itself, where code that can automate or change parts of the video endpoint behavior can run - avoiding the need to deploy a separate application server. Since both the device itself and any connected peripherals can be controlled from the Touch10 or DX series user interface, users get a consistent experience throughout the meeting room.

In-room controls and macros are explored in the [Creating custom in-room controls and xAPI apps](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/lab/collab-xapi-controls/step/1) and [Exploring on-board xAPI Macros for Cisco collaboration devices](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/lab/collab-xapi-macros/step/1) learning labs.

### Node.js xAPI library for JavaScript: jsxapi

More recently, in January 2018, the 'jsxapi' Node.js package was [released on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsxapi), and via an [opensource project on GitHub](https://github.com/cisco-ce/jsxapi). This library wraps xAPI functionality in an easy-to-use Node.js package for server-side JavaScript developers.

### xAPI documentation

For more details about installation, configuration and extensibility via xAPI, refer to these guides:

- [Docs for DX70 and DX80](http://www.cisco.com/go/dx-docs)
- [Docs for MX Series](http://www.cisco.com/go/mx-docs)
- [Docs for SX Series](http://www.cisco.com/go/sx-docs)
- [Docs for Room Series (RoomKit and Codec Plus)](http://www.cisco.com/go/roomkit-docs)
- [Docs for Webex Boards](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/collaboration-endpoints/spark-board/tsd-products-support-series-home.html)
- [Getting Started Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/telepresence/endpoint/ce95/dx70-dx80-sx10-sx20-sx80-mx200g2-mx300g2-mx700-mx800-room-kit-getting-started-guide-ce95.pdf) for DX, MX, SX, and Room Series

Note that these guides primarily apply to on-premise registered devices - cloud registered devices may support a more limited set of features depending on model CE version. We’ll cover some of these differences in the next sections. For now, note that you’ll find additional documentation for cloud-registered devices at [Collaboration Help](https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/jkhs20).

## Find your device's API documentation

Let’s now grab the documentation covering the available access methods and how to use the xAPI for your device:

1. Open the doc page that corresponds to your device type, from the links above. For example, if you have a Room Kit:
    
    ![Guides](assets/images/step1-guides.png)

2. Under **Reference Guides**, click **Command References** to access the API reference documentation for your device, and pick the relevant version such as the [RoomKit API Reference Guide for CE9.5](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/telepresence/endpoint/ce95/collaboration-endpoint-software-api-reference-guide-ce95.pdf)

    ![API reference](assets/images/step1-api-reference.png)

3. Look for the _About the API_ entry in the table of contents, and click it.

Congrats, you've accessed the documentation for your device's version of the xAPI!
