# Introduction to xAPI and Cisco CE Software Customization

## Objectives

Throughout this lab, we’ll explore the programmability of Cisco Collaboration Devices.

You’ll learn about xAPI – the API exposed by the [Cisco TelePresence CE9 software](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/telepresence/endpoint/software/ce9/release-notes/ce-software-release-notes-ce9.pdf), and how to invoke the API from SSH and HTTP.

To make it concrete, we’ll illustrate xAPI and CE customization by showing how to configure your device and start Video Calls, for both Spark and on-premises registered devices.


## Pre-requisites

To complete this lab, you need to have a Cisco Collaboration device at hand that:
- supports Cisco TelePresence CE software, typically a DX, SX, MX or RoomKit
- is registered to Cisco Spark or to an on-premises CUCM

Moreover, you need 'admin' credentials to your device if it's on-premises registered.
If Spark-registered, you need 'admin' access to the Control Hub of the Cisco Spark organization of your device.

You'll also need a laptop with local IP connectivity to your device, plus a SSH client and an HTTP client (either curl or Postman).


## Step 1: About CE Customization and xAPI

If you’re new to CE Customization and xAPI, here are a few starting points:
- your Cisco Collaboration Device embeds an API - also known as the xAPI - that allows bidirectional communication with third-party control systems, such as those from AMX or Crestron
- there are multiple ways to access this xAPI: Telnet, SSH, HTTP/HTTPS, Ethernet port, RS-232 serial connection. Regardless of the method you choose, the xAPI behaves the same
- in this lab, we’ll focus on the SSH and HTTP interfaces

**CE Customization and xAPI** has been historically available for the SX, MX, DX and Room Series video systems running CE – Cisco Collaboration Endpoint Software. 
The exact set of customization and API features and supported devices vary depending on the version of CE. Please check the [Cisco TelePresence CE software Release Note](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/telepresence/endpoint/software/ce9/release-notes/ce-software-release-notes-ce9.pdf) for the list of supported devices

_A note for DX owners: Cisco DX80 and Cisco DX70 were originally shipped with Android based software. Starting From Cisco Collaboration Endpoint software version 8.2 (CE8.2) all DX80 and DX70 units can run CE software, which is the software that runs on the Cisco TelePresence SX, MX and Room Kit Series._


### Recent updates

Back in January 2017, CE9 introduced in-room Controls. In-room controls let you add custom elements to your Touch10 operated video systems and DX Series user interface. Such user interface extensions may be in-room controls for lights or blinds, or other peripherals (including gone or more video switches to extend the number of video sources available), all controlled by external control systems.

More recently, in November 2017, CE9.2.1 took the customization possibilities further through the introduction of Branding and halfwake customization, but also a powerful Macros engine.
Macros allow you to write snippets of JavaScript code that can automate parts of your video endpoint behavior. Since both the Cisco video system itself and peripherals now can be controlled from the Touch10 or DX Series user interface, you will get a consistent user experience throughout the meeting room. Note that macros in the SX10 is not supported.
Macros and in-room controls are explored in complementary labs.


### Documentation

For more details about the CE Extensibility and the API, you can access the guides provided as PDF files from these device-specific pages:
- http://www.cisco.com/go/sx-docs for SX Series
- http://www.cisco.com/go/mx-docs for MX Series
- http://www.cisco.com/go/dx-docs for DX70 and DX80
- http://www.cisco.com/go/roomkit-docs for Room Kit and Codec Plus

Note that these guides apply primarly to on-premise registered devices as only a subset of the features described in these guides is available for Cisco Spark registered devices. We’ll cover some of these differences in the next section. For now, note that you’ll find more documentation for Spark-registered device at [Collaboration Help](https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/jkhs20).

Let’s now get a full description of the available access methods and how to use the xAPI for your Device.
 
**Open the guide** that corresponds to your device type, among the 'device specific pages' above. For example, open http://www.cisco.com/go/roomkit-docs if you own a Room Kit.

Among ‘Reference Guides’, click 'Command References' to access the API Reference documentation for your device, and pick the relevant version such as the [RoomKit API Reference Guide for CE9.2](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/telepresence/endpoint/ce92/room-kit-api-reference-guide-ce92.pdf) 

<div align="left">![API reference](/posts/files/collab-xapi-intro/assets/images/step1-api-reference.png)</div><br/><br/>

Look for the 'About the API' entry in the table of contents, and click it.
Congrats, you've reached to your device's documentation.
