# Step 6: Invoking the xAPI through a REST client

In this step, you’ll learn to interact with the xAPI through HTTP. 

The xAPI HTTP protocol details are detailled in your device’s API Reference Guide, as detailled on page 33 of [RoomKit's Reference Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/telepresence/endpoint/ce92/room-kit-api-reference-guide-ce92.pdf) for example.

Basically:
- your device’s xAPI proposes an HTTP endpoint at your device’s root path
- data are exchanged as `text/xml` payloads, and Basic Auth is used for authentication
- the `/getxml?location=` URI path is  used to retrieve Status information
- the `/putxml` URI path lets you post configuration & command requests

Let’s retrieve the current standby status via HTTP.

**For CURL users**, open a terminal and type the command below with your device’s ip-adress and credentials.

```shell
curl -X GET  'http://192.168.1.34/getxml?location=/Status/Standby'  -H 'Authorization: Basic aW50ZWdyYXRvcjppbnRlZ3JhdG9y '
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<Status product="Cisco Codec" version="ce9.3.0.344d3cf" apiVersion="4">
  <Standby>
    <State>Standby</State>
  </Standby>
</Status>
```

_Note that the `aW50ZWdyYXRvcjppbnRlZ3JhdG9y` authentication string below corresponds to the credentials of the integrator user: `integrator:integrator` encoded via Base64. You can use an online service such as [Base64Encode](https://www.base64encode.org/) if you are planning to use other credentials._

**For Postman users**, create a new GET request to your device’s /getxml endpoint, with an Authorization header with value: `Basic aW50ZWdyYXRvcjppbnRlZ3JhdG9y`

Let's sum it up: we’ve been experimenting the xAPI with a simple Standby use case, experimenting status, configuration and commands. 
For the last step of this lab, we’ll more advanced capabilities of your Collaboration Device and use xAPI to initiate a Video Call.
