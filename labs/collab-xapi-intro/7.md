# Step 7: Using the 'jsxapi' Library for Node.js

We will now invoke the xAPI from a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) JavaScript application, with the help of the open source NPM package [jsxapi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsxapi)

**-->If Node.js / NPM are not installed on your system, please visit https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/ for installation tips**

**Creating the Node.js project**

Our first step is to create the base folder/file structure for our jsxapi project:

1. In a terminal window, navigate to a directory where you'd like to store the project, and enter the commands below to create a new directory, and initialize the project structure:

  ```shell
  mkdir xapi-from-node
  cd xapi-from-node
  ```
  ```shell
  npm init
  ```
  Answer (or simply press enter for the defaults) a few basic NPM new package questions.  Then, enter:

  ```shell
  npm install jsxapi
  ```
  to install the jsxapi library (and dependencies)

2. Create your JavaScript source code file:

  Use your favorite developer text editor to create and open a file named `index.js` in the root of your new directory.  Paste in the contents below.  Make sure to replace with your device's actual IP address on line 4, and your user credentials on lines 5 and 6:

  ```javascript
  const jsxapi = require('jsxapi');

  //create the jsxapi connection object
  const xapi = jsxapi.connect("ssh://{device_ip}", {
      username: 'integrator',
      password: 'integrator'
  });

  xapi.on('error', (err) => {  //handler for any errors encountered with jsxapi
      console.error(`connection failed: ${err}, exiting`);
      process.exit(1); //just exit the app
  });

  //when the jsxapi connection is ready...
  xapi.on('ready', () => {
      console.log("connection successful");

      // Retrieve and display the current Standby status
      xapi.status
          .get('Standby')
          .then((status) => {
              console.log(`Current Standby status: ${status.State}`);

              // shutdown the jsxapi connection/object
              xapi.close();
          });
  });
  ```
  Be sure to save the file when you're done

3. Now, let's launch your application:

  In the terminal you used above, enter the command:

  ```shell
  node index.js
  ```
  and check the value returned by your script:
  ```shell
  Current Standby status: Halfwake
  ```

>Note: if you get a 'client-timeout' error, check that the IP Address in your code is correct, and that the SSH protocol is enabled for your device in the web admin configuration

**Awesome: you just accessed your device from Node.js**

Since the jsxapi module exposes the same bindings as the core xAPI framework (similar command names, property names, values, etc.), you can easily read status, configure and send commands to your devices from JavaScript (it's also possible to register for and receive xAPI HTTP events in Node.js.)
