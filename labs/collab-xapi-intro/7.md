# Using the Node.js 'jsxapi' library

We will now invoke the xAPI from a Node.js application, with the help of the 'jsxapi' module.


**If Node.js or NPM are not installed on your system, you can download the installer from http://nodejs.org**

Open a terminal, and type the commands below to crate a new folder, and install the jsxapi library:

```shell
mkdir xapi-from-node
cd xapi-from-node
npm install jsxapi
``` 

Then create a file named 'standby.js', and paste the contents below.
Make sure to place your device's ip-address on line 2, and your Integrator's credentials on lines 3 and 4:

```javascript
const jsxapi = require('jsxapi');
const xapi = jsxapi.connect("ssh://10.10.1.10", {
    username: 'integrator',
    password: 'integrator'
});
xapi.on('error', (err) => {
    console.error(`connexion failed: ${err}, exiting`);
    process.exit(1);
});

xapi.on('ready', () => {
    console.log("connexion successful");

    // Display current Standby status
    xapi.status
        .get('Standby')
        .then((status) => {
            console.log(`Current Standby status: ${status}`);

            // Ending script
            xapi.close();
        });
});
```

Now, let's launch your script. 
From the same folder where you installed the jsxapi module, type the command below, and check the value returned by your script.

```shell
node standby.js

Current Standby status: off
```

_If you get a client-timeout, check the ip adress in your code is correct, and that the ssh protocol is activated for your device_

**Awesome: you just accessed your device from Node.js**


_Note that the module exposes the same bindings that are used in the Macro framework, so that you can read status, configure your devices, send commands and listen to events from Node.js_


Here are a few pointers if you are interested to learn more about the 'jxapi':
- check the source code in the [jsxapi repo on github](https://github.com/cisco-ce/jsxapi)
- follow these instructions to [generate the documentation](https://github.com/cisco-ce/jsxapi#documentation)
- get inspired by [running these jsxapi examples](https://github.com/ObjectIsAdvantag/xapi-samples/tree/master/jsxapi) against your own device
