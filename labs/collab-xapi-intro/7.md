# Step 7: Starting a Video Call via xAPI

To start with, reach to the documentation in the API reference Guide of your device.
If you own a RoomKit device, reach to page 119 of the [API Reference Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/telepresence/endpoint/ce92/room-kit-api-reference-guide-ce92.pdf). 

_Note that URLs to reference guides for DX, SX and MX devices are provided in step 1 of this lab_

As described in the Dial reference above, the command is available for all roles but ‘Controler’ since the main purpose of this role is to configure the device, not to use it. 

**Let’s now dial a Video call.**

For the sake of this example, we’ll use the SIP autoresponder `roomkit@sparkdemos.com` proposed by the CE team in Oslo.

Open a SSH session, and type `xcommand Dial Number: roomkit@sparkdemos.com`

The call is instantly initiated, and a call identifier is returned
 This identifier could be used to disconnect the call.

```shell
xcommand Dial Number: roomkit@sparkdemos.com

OK
*r DialResult (status=OK):
*r DialResult CallId: 7
*r DialResult ConferenceId: 4
** end
```

Let’s now initiate this call from HTTP

**For CURL users**, type the command below in a terminal:

```shell
curl -X POST \
  http://192.168.1.34/putxml \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic aW50ZWdyYXRvcjppbnRlZ3JhdG9y' \
  -H 'Content-Type: text/xml' \
  -d '<Command><Dial><Number>roomkit@sparkdemos.com</Number></Dial></Command>'
```

**For Postman users**, open a new POST request with the same 'Authorization' header as in step 6 and above. Fill in the XML payload as specified below:

Congrats! 
In this lab, you learnt how the xAPI let you take action straight from a SSH terminal, but also through HTTP. 
By replicating the HTTP requests of this lab from your favorite programming language, you can now control and interact with your Cisco Collaboration device straight from your own applications. 


## To go further

We suggest you take to the other labs of the xAPI module in order to learn more about programmability capabilities of your device, such as macros, in-room controls and webhooks.

Postman users will also be interested to load the [postman collections for xAPI](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/postman-xapi), as these collections propose typical device interactions such as: 'Standby', 'Video Calls', but also 'Personalization' and 'Room Analytics'.
