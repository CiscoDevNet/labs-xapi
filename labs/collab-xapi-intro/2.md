# Step 2: Getting Started with your Collaboration Device

To start with, we’ll show you how to interact with your Collaboration Device from its built-in Web Interface.

As Cisco Collaboration devices can be registered either to Cisco Spark or on-premises to a CUCM service, the way to access the local web interface will vary. In this step, we’ll give details for on-premises device. 

**Jump to the next section if you want to access a Spark-registered device.**

Make sure your laptop has local connectivity to your collaboration device Connect and type its ip-adress in a Web Browser.
You’ll be redirected to a login banner.
In the example below, we typed '10.55.152.41' and got redirected to https://10.55.152.41/web/signin

As an admin user, you get access to all CE features through a friendly interface.
For the purpose of this lab, we’ve opted to stick the 'Status', 'Configuration' and 'Call' features exposed to the Integrator role.


## Integrator Role

We’ll now create a new and distinct user powered with the Integrator role authorization.

Click the 'Security' menu, select 'Users' and fill in the form as specified below:
- pick 'integrator' as user name
- select the sole Integrator role 
- enter ‘integrator’ as Passphrase
