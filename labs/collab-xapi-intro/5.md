# Step 5: Interacting with xAPI Using SSH

The room device's xAPI is accessible from a simple SSH connection, which lets you interact from the command line (this is how many 3rd party control systems interact with xAPI, e.g. Crestron/AMX).   From there you can request status information, update the device configuration, listen for events and send commands to your device.

Let’s experiment!

> Note that if you cannot open a SSH connection to your device, theres a chance SSH access has been disabled by an admin. To enable SSH, connect to your device's web interface as an admin, open `Setup > Configuration > NetworkServices` and look for SSH among the list of protocols

1. Log in to the room device via SSH:
  * **For Mac and Linux users**: from a terminal, open a SSH connection to your device by entering:
  ```shell
  ssh <device_ip> -l integrator
  ```

  * **For Windows users**: launch `Putty` (see this lab's BYOD/pre-requisites), start a new session with your device's ip address, and click **Open**. Enter your integrator user credentials:

  > Note: if you're having trouble logging in, make sure 'Require passphrase change on next user sign in' is disabled for the integrator user in the web admin under **Security > Users**

2. Use the `xstatus` command to retrieve the device's standby state.  In the SSH session, enter:
```shell
xstatus /Standby
```
 and check that the displayed info corresponds to the same information in the web interface

   ```shell
   *s Standby State: Standby
   ** end
   ```
   > Note that the `*s` prefix in the response stands for `Status information`. The SSH interface supports helpful command completion at any point by pressing `Tab`

3. Next let's view the various attributes of the device's standby configuration, enter:
  ```shell
  xconfiguration Standby
  ```
  which should return something like:
  ```shell
  *c xConfiguration Standby BootAction: DefaultCameraPosition
  *c xConfiguration Standby Control: On
  *c xConfiguration Standby Delay: 10
  *c xConfiguration Standby StandbyAction: PrivacyPosition
  *c xConfiguration Standby WakeupAction: RestoreCameraPosition
  *c xConfiguration Standby WakeupOnMotionDetection: On
  ** end
  ```

**Let’s now experiment with using 'xcommands' to change the state of the device**

1. Make sure your room device is in standby state.  You can do this manually via the web admin, under `Setup > Personalization` by clicking **Put the system in standby state**

2. From SSH, use a `xcommand` request to disable standby mode:
  ```shell
  xcommand Standby Deactivate
  ```
  which will return with:

  ```shell
  *r StandbyDeactivateResult (status=OK):
  ** end
  ```

3. Visually confirm that your device has left standby mode

  >Note: you can remotely view what's on the screen of the room device or its Touch10 controller via the web interface, under `Maintenance > User Interface Screenshots`.  If your device does not have a main screen attached (e.g. Sandbox), view the Touch10 interface  

4. Next, let's use `xstatus` to confirm the standby status:
  ```shell
  xstatus Standby
  ```
  which should return something like:
  ```shell
  *s Standby State: Halfwake
  ** end
  ```

**Finally, let’s experiment with events**

xAPI provides the ability to register for 'events' generated by the room device.  Events can be anything from a change in standby status, to an outgoing call being placed, to a change in the number of faces detected by the camera.  

A room device in operation may produce a very high number or different events in production operation, including many events your application may not care about.  xAPI provides the ability to indicate very specific or very general event filters, so that you receive only the events you are interested in.

Let's see how this works:

1. First, let's put the device in standby mode, if it's not already.  Enter
  ```shell
  xcommand Standby Activate
  ```

2. Next, let's register to receive events when the standby status changes:
  ```shell
  xfeedback register /Status/Standby
  ```

2. Finally, turn standby mode off with an `xcommand`:
  ```shell
  xcommand Standby Deactivate
  ```

Check to see that following event message fires in your SSH window:

```shell
*s Standby State: Off
** end
```

If you wait another 5 minutes (or whatever delay you configured in the previous step), you would also see new events flying by as shown below:

```shell
*s Standby State: EnteringStandby
** end
*s Standby State: Standby
** end
```

Moreover, if you were to leave the room for awhile and re-enter, you might see this extra event, if you enabled `WakeupOnMotionDetection` previously:

```shell
*s Standby State: Halfwake
** end
```

## Going Further

A great way to learn about your device's features is to use the same commands we used earlier, but with a wider 'scope'.  By not specifying a particular feature, executing these commands will instead print out a list of all the available options and sub-options under the command.

At your own pace, try the following commands, just on their own:
-	`xstatus`
-	`xconfiguration`

What could you do with the information provided?  Feel fry to try out some of the options for each!

The scope of events you receive can be narrowed or widened depending on the 'path' you provide to the `xfeedback register` command.

Try entering `xfeedback register /Status` to listen to all status changes, or simply `xfeedback register /` to listen to every type of event, systemwide. Then perform various interactions with your device such as turning up or down the volume, or initiating a call. As the xfeedback events can get pretty numerous/verbose, make sure to type `xfeedback deregisterall` to turn off all event registrations when you're finished.


**Congrats, you've just learned about Cisco room device programmability!**

In essence, the xAPI is a bi-directional interface that lets you check your device state, modify configuration settings, register for real-time events, and take actions by sending commands.

These actions can be taken from the physical device controls (or Touch10), its web interface, or SSH.  

Next, we'll talk about an additional avenue for accessing xAPI we haven't yet covered: via HTTP...
