# Step 5: Interacting with xAPI through SSH

Your device's xAPI is accessible from a simple SSH connection that lets you interact from the command line: request status information, update your device configuration options, listen to events or send command to your device.

Let’s now experiment with this!

_Note that if you cannot open a SSH connection to your device, there’s a good chance it has SSH disabled. To enable SSH, connect to your device's Web Interface as admin, open 'Setup > Configuration > NetworkServices' and look for SSH among the list of protocols._


**For Unix and Mac users**: from a terminal, open a ssh connection to your device by typing a command such as: `ssh <device IP> -l integrator`

**For For Windows users**: launch Putty, fill in a new session with your device's ip address, and click 'Open'. Then enter your integrator user credentials.

From your 'ssh' session, type `xstatus /Standby` and check the displayed info corresponds to the same information on the Web interface.

_Note that the `*s` prefix on the response stands for `Status information`. The SSH-interface supports helpful command completion by using `Tab`._

```shell
xstatus Standby
*s Standby State: Standby
** end
```

Next, type `xconfiguration Standby` to fetch your device's configuration settings.


**Let’s now experiment how commands can let you change the state of the device.**

Type ` xcommand Standby Deactivate` to turn your device on.

```shell
xcommand Standby Deactivate
*r StandbyDeactivateResult (status=OK):
** end
```

Confirm that your device has turned on.

Next, type `xstatus Standby` to check your device’s current state.


**Finally, let’s experiment with events**

Type `xfeedback register /Status/Standby` to start listening to 'Standby' state change events.

Then, enter the `xcommand Standby Deactivate` to turn your device on.

Check the following events did fire in your terminal:

```shell
xfeedback register /Status/Standby
** end
OK

xcommand Standby Deactivate
*r StandbyDeactivateResult (status=OK):
** end
*s Standby State: Off
** end
```

If you waited more than 5 minutes (or whatever delay you configured in the previous step), you would also see new events flying by as shown below:

```shell
*s Standby State: EnteringStandby
** end
*s Standby State: Standby
** end
```

Moreover if you were to leave and re-enter the meeting room, you’d see this extra event, since we turned on `WakeupOnMotionDetection` earlier in this lab.

```shell
*s Standby State: Halfwake
** end
```

## To go further

A great way to learn your device features is to use the same commands you typed earlier but with a wider scope.

At your own pace, try the following commands :
-	`xstatus`
-	`xconfiguration`
-	`xfeedback register /Status` to listen to all state changes, or simply `xfeedback register /` to listen to all events. Then perform various interactions with your device such as turning up or down the sound and even initiate a call. As the feedbacks can be pretty verbose, type `xfeedback deregisterall` to turn off all registrations.


**Congrats, you just learned about your device programmability!**

In essence, the xAPI is a bi-directional API that lets you check your device state, modify configuration settings, register to events and take actions by sending commands.

These actions can be taken from the Device itself, its Web Interface, or SSH, but also via HTTP(S) as we’ll see in the next step of this lab.
