# Step 5: Interacting with xAPI through SSH

Your device's xAPI is accessible from a simple SSH connection that lets you interact from the command line: request status information, update your device configuration options, listen to events or send command to your device.

Let’s now experiment this.

**For Unix and Mac users**: from a terminal, open a ssh connection to your device by typing a command such as: `ssh 192.168.1.34 -l integrator`

**For For Windows users**: lanuch Putty, fill in a new session with your device's ip-address, and click open. Then enter your integrator user credentials.

Notes:
- if you cannot open a SSH connection to your device, there’s good chance the administrator of the device has turned ssh mode off. Open a SSH connection to your device’s ip address and login with your integrator user credentials.
- when connecting as integrator via SSH, you get automatically access to an xAPI shell session. If connecting as admin, you get access to a bash-type session; type `tsh` to switch to the xAPI shell.


From your ssh session, type `xstatus /Standby` and check the displayed info corresponds to the same information on the Web interface.

_Note that the `*s` prefix on the response tands for `Status information`. Also completion is supported with to the `Tab`key._

```shell
xstatus Standby
*s Standby State: Standby
** end
```

Next, type `xconfiguration Standby ` to fetch your device's configuration settings.

**Let’s now experiment how commands can let you change the state of the device.**

Type ` xcommand Standby Deactivate` to turn your system on.

```shell
xcommand Standby Deactivate
*r StandbyDeactivateResult (status=OK):
** end
```

Check your device has turned on.

Next, type `xstatus  Standby` to check your device’s current state.

If you waited 5 minutes, you would also see your device updated as show below:

```shell
xstatus Standby
*s Standby State: EnteringStandby
** end
```

**Finally, let’s experiment events**

Type `xfeedback register /Standby` to start listening to 'Standby' state change events.

Then, enter the `xcommand Standby Deactivate` to tunr your device on.

Check the following events fire in your terminal:

```shell
xfeedback register /Status/Standby
** end
OK

xcommand Standby Deactivate
*r StandbyDeactivateResult (status=OK):
** end
*s Standby State: Off
** end
```

If you wait a few minutes, you’ll even these events fyling in:

```shell
*s Standby State: EnteringStandby
** end
*s Standby State: Standby
** end
```

Moreover if you were to leave and re-enter the meeting room, you’d see this extra event flying, since we turned on `WakeupOnMotionDetection` earlier in this lab.

```shell
*s Standby State: Halfwake
** end
```

## To go further 

A great way to learn your device features is to use the same commands you typed earlier but with a wider scope.

At your own pace, try the following commands :
-	`xstatus`
-	`xconfiguration`
-	`xfeedback register /Status` to listen to all state changes, or simply `xfeedback register /` to listen to all events. Then perform various interactions with your device such as turning up or down the sound and even initiate a call. As the feedbacks can be pretty verbose, type `xfeedback deregisterall` to turn off all registrations.


**Congrats, you just learnt about your device programmability!**

Simply stated, the xAPI is a bi-directional API that lets you check your device state, modify configuration settings, register to events and take actions by sending commands. 

These actions can be taken from the Device itself, its Web Interface, or SSH, but also via HTTP(S) as we’ll see in the next step of this lab.
