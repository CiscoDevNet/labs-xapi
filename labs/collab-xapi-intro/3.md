# Step 3: Accessing the Admin Web Interface for Webex Teams-Registered Devices

**-->If your device is registered to CUCM/VCS on-premise and you've created the 'integrator' user, you can [skip to the next step](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/lab/collab-xapi-intro/step/4)**

Follow the instructions below if your device is registered with Cisco Webex Teams:

1. Login to the [Cisco Webex Control Hub](https://admin.webex.com) as an admin for the Cisco Webex Teams organization that manages your room device
  > Note: Make sure to use a modern browser such as Chrome or Firefox. Internet Explorer is not compatible with the following instructions

2. Navigate to the **Devices** page in Control Hub, and select your device from the list

3. Scroll down through the 'Device Details' on the right, and click  **Launch Advanced Settings**
  >Note: Access to advanced settings through the Control Hub may be disabled for some organizations. If you don't see the 'Launch Advanced Settings' link among your device's properties, please contact your Webex Teams support contact for assistance

5. A new browser window will open at `https://{room_device_ip}/cloud-login`, displaying the _Administration Web Interface_ for your device
  >Note: If you are not connected to the same network as your room device, or it's IP address is otherwise unreachable, the web page will time out after a few seconds, and the Control Hub dialog will show 'Advanced Settings Unavailable - Connecting to the room device was unsuccessful'

## Creating an 'Integrator' User

Let’s now create a new user with the 'integrator' role, which limits xAPI access to features and functions likely to be used by applications and third-party control systems deployed by system integrators/partners.  (To find out more about local user roles for Webex Teams registered devices, check the [Local User Administration](https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/DOC-17938) article on CollabHelp.)

1. Click the **Security** menu, select **Users**, then **+ Create new user** and fill in the form as specified below:
  - Enter 'integrator' as Username
  - Enter ‘integrator’ as Passphrase
  - Select the 'Integrator' role
