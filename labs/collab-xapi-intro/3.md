# Step 3: Instructions for Spark-registered Devices

Sign at the [Cisco Spark Control Hub](https://admin.ciscospark.com) of the organization that your device is registered against.

_Make sure to use a Web browser such as Chrome or Firefox along the lab as Internet Explorer is not supported._


Navigate to the 'Devices' page in Control Hub, and select your device in the list.

Scroll down the 'Device Details' on the right, and **click 'Launch Advanced Settings'**.

_Note that access to advanced settings through the Control Hub is available for selected organizations. If you don't see “Launch Advanced Settings” in the portal, please ask your partner or Cisco contact to enable it._

A confirmation dialog opens: click 'proceed'.
A new browser window opens at `http(s)://<endpoint ip or hostname>/cloud-login` and redirects to Web Interface of your device.

_Note that you did not need to authenticate: as you initiated the loginflow from the Control Hub, you got automatically logged in as a Spark Admin account, whose sole purpose is to let you create new local users._

Let’s now create this new user with integrator role, that will give you access to your device’s configuration and let you program against the xAPI.
To find out more about the local user roles proposed for Spark-registered devices, check the [Local User Administration](https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/DOC-17938) article on CollabHelp.


## Integrator Role

We’ll now create a new and distinct user powered with the Integrator role.

Click the 'Security' menu, select 'Users' and fill in the form as specified below:
- pick 'integrator' as user name
- select the sole Integrator role 
- enter ‘integrator’ as Passphrase
