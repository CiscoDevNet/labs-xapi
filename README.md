## Cisco DevNet Learning Labs: Labs XAPI

These self-paced interactive tutorials provide instructions for developers to learn how to use XAPIs.

We write these labs for display within the [Cisco DevNet Learning Labs system](https://developer.cisco.com/learning).

Contributions are welcome, and we are glad to review changes through pull requests. See [contributing.md](contributing.md) for details.

Once approved, Cisco DevNet reviewers then create a release to publish through our Learning Labs system.

The goal of these Learning Labs is to ensure a 'hands-on' learning approach rather than theory or instructions.

## About these Learning Labs

These labs teach how to:
* Use XAPI controls.
* Use XAPI branding.

If you need more help, you can reach out to DevNet through one of our [support options](https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/support/).

## Preview Learning Lab Markdown locally

Refer to the instruction for your text editor for Markdown previewing. For example, [Markdown and Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/markdown) describes how to configure Markdown extensions. 

## Contributor guidelines

These learning modules are for public consumption, so you must ensure that you have the rights to any content that you contribute.

Write your content in Markdown. DevNet staff reviews content according to the [Cisco Style Guide](http://www-author.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/general/style/guide/Latest/stylegd.html). (Link available on Cisco VPN only.)

#### Publishing requirements

To create and publish a new lab, take the following steps:
- Add a new folder under `labs`.
- Create a JSON file with the same name as the `labs/`_folder_ name.
- Create markdown files named 1.md, 2.md, and so on; refer to those files in the `labs/`_folder_ JSON file.
- Ensure that the JSON file contains appropriate page titles and file references.
- Send a pull request to get the files committed and merged to the default branch by a DevNet reviewer.

A DevNet reviewer then creates a release on the repository with the latest changes and publishes through the admin interface.

#### Editors

You can write Markdown in a plain text editor, and desktop and Web-based options allow you to simultaneously write and preview your work. We recommend Visual Studio Code [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for these reasons:
- Lightweight environment for coding (or writing Markdown).
- Available on macOS, Linux, or Windows.
- Github Client integration.
- Great Markdown preview features native in the editor.
- Intuitive operation and structure.

You can validate a JSON file by using the [online formatter and validator](https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com).
